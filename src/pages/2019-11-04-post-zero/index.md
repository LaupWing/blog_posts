# Best way to learn code (according to me)

## A Little bit about myself
Recently i have made a big switch from being unproductive and uninterested in learning code to someone who strive to learn something new about coding everyday. I am a person with extreme ends. If i want to be lazy i will make sure i am the laziest person ever, but on the flipside if i want to learn something i will do everything in my power to do it and so efficient as possible. So here began my journey to learn code and trying to find the best possible way to learn it efficient.
  
But how does one find the best way of learning code efficient? By trying bunch of things out and research! My learning journey began with a lot of watching video's related to coding (mainly tutorials). I learned code simply watching tutorial for hours on end. Sometimes i would a tutorial watch for 5 hours straight. Usually i would start coding after i finished a tutorial. What i found out is that is the most unefficient way of learning ever. Always after the tutorial i forgot everything what i have watched. This is by far the most uneffecient way of learning
- [x] ~~first watching tutorials than coding~~

After this experience i have learned to write down the stuff that i learned from the tutorial. So what did i do as a extreme person? Well i wrote every single f**king single line of code down so i will not forget what i had learned. Im not joking i litteraly wrote every line of code of the tutorials i was watching for one week straight. Dont believe me watch these images below and cringe.
